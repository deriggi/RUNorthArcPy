## ArcPy at RAMP UP North
Welcome to the RAMP UP North GIS Unit's GitHub Site! This site contains the Python examples, lessons,
and projects we will be using for this project. We are learning Python so that we can build the software
infrastrucutre required for the safayi registration integration task. Also Python is a great way to automate common
ArcGIS tasks

### Learning Python
Lessons for basic Python programming and introductory ArcPy are used to help ease the learning curve. ArcPy has an 
extensive API so understanding basic Python command structures is essential for building stable and reusable software
