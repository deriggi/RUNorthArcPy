## ArcPy at RAMP UP North
Welcome to the RAMP UP North GIS Unit's GitHub Site! This site contains the Python examples, lessons,
and projects we will be using for this project. We are learning Python so that we can build the software
infrastrucutre required for the safayi registration integration task. Also Python is a great way to automate common
ArcGIS tasks

### Learning Python
Lessons for basic Python programming and introductory ArcPy are used to help ease the learning curve. ArcPy has an 
extensive API so understanding basic Python command structures is essential for building stable and reusable software

#### First Lessons


#### ArcPy Assignments

The first assignment requires writing an arcpy script to iterate through spatial data, get the centroid, and write the
data out as json.

Assignment two requires the programmers to query the sql server database using attribute values of the spatial data

In retrospect it would have been easier to do a CSV example first, but these json files are an important
part of the IFMS integration effort here

The JSON format can then be embedded into web applications
