                    Installation of the linked data will not be finished until the Safayi data entry is complete for every municipality and the GIS unit has updated their parcel data according the new parcel numbers created during registration

                <h2 class="content-subhead architecture">Overall Architecture and Identification of Two Users</h2>
                <p>
                    Integrating the Safayi registration data with the spatial data was one of the main objectives of the STTA. The purpose of the integration is to provide functionality for two distinct users: the IFMS user and the GIS Analyst user.
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>GIS User: interacts primarily with spatial data in ArcGIS and wishes to have the option of viewing tabular data from the IFMS for parcels selected on the map</li>
                    <li>IFMS User: interacts with the IFMS web application and wants to have the option of viewing  the location of a particular parcel on a map</li>
                </ol>

                    <div class='pure-u-1'> <img src = "images/architecture.png" alt='mosque'/> </div>
                </div>


                <h2 class="content-subhead software">Devlopment of Software for Two Use Cases</h2>
                <p>
                    The data integration effort was divided into two separate software packages, one for the GIS user and one for the IFMS user. Each package was placed on the free open source repository called GitHub. The repo makes it easy to combine documentation and raw code together in one coherent searchable web site
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the GIS User the objective was to join the IFMS’s tabular data in SQL Server to the spatial data in ArcGIS. The limitation is that the ArcGIS can only easily join two separate data sets based on a single field. There are a few ways to approach this but the cleanest method was to attach the primary key of the target IFMS table to the spatial data, and then do the ArcGIS join and relate operations on the primary key to complete the join. The GisCode field would have been a potentially simpler option but there is a bug in the IFMS for certain combinations of parcel, district, and guzer rendering the field unreliable for universal operations. <a href ="https://github.com/deriggi/RUNorthArcPy/blob/master/advanced/pkattacher.py">This Python script</a> was developed as a configurable tool to assist with the join. The team in the GIS Unit office practiced a few sample operations with the data
                </p>

                <p>
                    The goal of the IFMS user development was to build a GIS extension into the IFMS that would give the user the option of interacting with a map showing the location of a particular parcel
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the first iteration we considered the simplest possible solution, in which static map images of every parcel would be deployed to the IFMS server. This way, when the user clicked on the map link on the IFMS, they would be presented with a simple web page containing several images of the parcel at different zoom levels. The advantages of a system like this are its simplicity and relatively easy installation. The disadvantage is the tens of thousands of map images that would need to be created, potentially requiring days to generate. The ultimate solution involved building a simple interactive web map from the parcel data and using the IFMS web server as a tile server for the 
                    map.

                    With the survey data transmission not yet complete, the 3000 sample records from the Mazar-e Sharif IFMS were used to analyze the structure and contents of the database. The goals for the DB analysis were:

                    The survey teams and the GIS team coordinate on data collection and parcel boundary identification. Maps are first created by the GIS team and then delivered to the property registration team to serve as a guide for data collection. Parcel IDs are assigned to each property and written on paper satellite images of each block. The maps are delivered back to the GIS team where another data entry process updates the spatial data with the new parcel IDs.

                <h2 class="content-subhead dataquality">Data Quality Tool</h2>

                <p>
                    A tool was built to validate the attribute fields in the spatial data. Specifically, each parcel in the dataset lists the District, Block, and sometimes the Guzer in which the parcel belongs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Considering the spatial relationships, each level of the boundary hierarchy is within its parent boundary demarcations. Therefore, the spatial relationship can be used to determine the validity of the attribute data. The <a href='https://github.com/deriggi/RUNorthArcPy/blob/master/advanced/DataQuality.pyt'>code </a> for the data quality tool iterates through each parcel and performs the following steps:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Calculate the center point of the parcel</li>
                    <li>Determine if the block containing this point is the same as that listed in the attribute field for the parcel</li>
                    <li>Determine if the district containing this point is the same as that listed in the attribute field</li>
                    <li>Display results to the user</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Recommendation from Waheed is to build a tool which helps identify parcel overlaps and gaps between parcels which are close to one another.

                    Introductory Python programming was provided most of the last 10 days of the effort. The purpose of the training was to get the team comfortable working with code and to help them apply Python to make GIS tasks easier, less repetitive, and less susceptible to error. Also, the integration software developed for for the GIS User was written in Python so familiarizing the team with the code should make them more capable of operating the integration.
