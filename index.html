                <p>
                    Integrating the Safayi registration data with the spatial data was one of the main objectives of the STTA. The purpose of the integration is to provide functionality for two distinct users: the IFMS user and the GIS Analyst user.

                    <li>IFMS User: interacts with the IFMS web application and wants to have the option of viewing  the location of a particular parcel on a map</li>

                <h2 class="content-subhead software">Devlopment of Software for Two Use Cases</h2>
                <p>
                    The data integration effort was divided into two separate software packages, one for the GIS user and one for the IFMS user. Each package was placed on the free open source repository called GitHub. The repo makes it easy to combine documentation and raw code together in one coherent searchable web site
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the GIS User the objective was to join the IFMSâ€™s tabular data in SQL Server to the spatial data in ArcGIS. The limitation is that the ArcGIS can only easily join two separate data sets based on a single field. There are a few ways to approach this but the cleanest method was to attach the primary key of the target IFMS table to the spatial data, and then do the ArcGIS join and relate operations on the primary key to complete the join. The GisCode field would have been a potentially simpler option but there is a bug in the IFMS for certain combinations of parcel, district, and guzer rendering the field unreliable for universal operations. <a href ="https://github.com/deriggi/RUNorthArcPy/blob/master/advanced/pkattacher.py">This Python script</a> was developed as a configurable tool to assist with the join. The team in the GIS Unit office practiced a few sample operations with the data
                </p>

                <p>
                    The goal of the IFMS user development was to build a GIS extension into the IFMS that would give the user the option of interacting with a map showing the location of a particular parcel
                </p>



                <p>
                    For the first iteration we considered the simplest possible solution, in which static map images of every parcel would be deployed to the IFMS server. This way, when the user clicked on the map link on the IFMS, they would be presented with a simple web page containing several images of the parcel at different zoom levels. The advantages of a system like this are its simplicity and relatively easy installation. The disadvantage is the tens of thousands of map images that would need to be created, potentially requiring days to generate. The ultimate solution involved building a simple interactive web map from the parcel data and using the IFMS web server as a tile server for the 
                    map.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One of the major contstraints of the application development is that it needed to function without a connection to the public internet

                    With the survey data transmission not yet complete, the 3000 sample records from the Mazar-e Sharif IFMS were used to analyze the structure and contents of the database. The goals for the DB analysis were:

                <p>
                    This assessment is of a narrow slice of the system, derived mostly from the work with the property data and GIS data integration effort at RAMP UP North. The IFMS is standard three tiered web application running on a Microsoft SQL Sever and ASP.NET stack. The source code for the business logic of the application was not available so this is a "black-box" assessment. Overall, the system is reliable in regards to its core components of functionality which are to create, read, update and delete property data recorded in the field during the Safayi registration process.  
                </p>
                 
                <p>
                    The IFMS is capable of running entirely without a connection to the public internet. This is an advatage from a security perspective. Conversely though, it does not seem to have been built with interoperability in mind. Lacking in the IFMS are web-level or application-level APIs that would make the system extensible and accessible to approved
                    third party systems. Interoperability may be a central concern for integration of each IFMS into a national IFMS Hub. The best path for the IFMS Hub development is to develop a standard data structure and format into which each individual IFMS data set can be exported. Doing so will make it easier to run comparisons and downloads across different systems    
               </p>

                <p>
                    A dearth of protections against data quality probems is the biggest deficiency for the property registration component. This is a common problem for systems in which data entry is preformed en masse from paper records. A more stringent set of data types, field-size restrictions, and user alerts for suspect data could be integrated into the system to prevent the data from making it into the database. Retroactively, tools could be added to teh IFMS to check for data quality problems that are already present 
               </p>               


                <p> 
                    <strong>Too few data quality checks at the application layer </strong> Data entry technicians enter data manually from paper based property surveys. There are few protections from problems related to the free text fields. For example, in the 3000 sized sample data set for Mazar-e Sharif, person names were found to have been entered into a field reserved for the neighbourhood name field for the property.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Too few data quality checks at the database layer.</strong> Particularly regarding field length and uniqueness on several fields. Some data quality checks could be put in place to prevent description data being placed in the Elder Fatherâ€™s name field, where it was found to be in some situations.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>The property and unit table data storage  is inefficient.</strong> Properties can have multiple units which should be stored as child elements of the the Property itself. Instead they are repeated in the property table with an implicit parent-child relationship defined by the formatting of the registration number
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Relationships between owners and properties is not clearly defined. </strong> There are no explicit primary key and foreign key relationships between the property table and the major entities supporting it
                </p>

                

                <h4 class="content-subhead">Known Bugs</h4>
                <p>The GISCode field in the Property table is known to insert incorrectly when the district, block and guzer are all equal to 1. The effect is that hyphens are stripped from the code rendering it inconsistent with the other GIS codes in the table</p>


                <h2 class="content-subhead workflow">Safayi Survey and GIS Team Workflow</h2>

                <p>
                    The survey teams and the GIS team coordinate on data collection and parcel boundary identification. Maps are first created by the GIS team and then delivered to the property registration team to serve as a guide for data collection. Parcel IDs are assigned to each property and written on paper satellite images of each block. The maps are delivered back to the GIS team where another data entry process updates the spatial data with the new parcel IDs.

                <h2 class="content-subhead dataquality">Data Quality Tool</h2>

                <p>
                    A tool was built to validate the attribute fields in the spatial data. Specifically, each parcel in the dataset lists the District, Block, and sometimes the Guzer in which the parcel belongs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Considering the spatial relationships, each level of the boundary hierarchy is within its parent boundary demarcations. Therefore, the spatial relationship can be used to determine the validity of the attribute data. The <a href='https://github.com/deriggi/RUNorthArcPy/blob/master/advanced/DataQuality.pyt'>code </a> for the data quality tool iterates through each parcel and performs the following steps:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Calculate the center point of the parcel</li>
                    <li>Determine if the block containing this point is the same as that listed in the attribute field for the parcel</li>
                    <li>Determine if the district containing this point is the same as that listed in the attribute field</li>
                    <li>Display results to the user</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Recommendation from Waheed is to build a tool which helps identify parcel overlaps and gaps between parcels which are close to one another.

                <p>
                    Introductory Python programming was provided most of the last 10 days of the effort. The purpose of the training was to get the team comfortable working with code and to help them apply Python to make GIS tasks easier, less repetitive, and less susceptible to error. Also, the integration software developed for for the GIS User was written in Python so familiarizing the team with the code should make them more capable of operating the integration.

                <p>
                    The GitHub site contains a set of introductory lessons followed by four GIS related projects

                    Two of the staff receiving the training seemed particularly interested in continuing to work with the programming language

                <p>
                    The GIS Analystsâ€™ skills are strong with the ArcGIS software suite. They understand how to manipulate attribute data and produce cartographic products at different scales with different types of imagery. Their experience with building maps online is limited. We worked through some basic examples with TileMill and a few other tools using the teamâ€™s parcel data.
